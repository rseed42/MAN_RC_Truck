# Modifications

.pull-left[

### Adding computer and sensors

- Replaced remote control unit with [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.google.com)

- Added [two ultrasonic distance sensors](https://www.google.com) (front highlighted)

- Added [accelerometer](https://www.google.com)

- Added [wide angle camera](https://www.google.com) (highlighted)

- Added [10k mAh powerbank](https://www.google.com) to power the Raspberry

- Fancy blue and black metallic paint job (done by ourselves)

# The Foundation

## Hardware wiring, RobotOS

---
# Implementation: The Foundation

### Wiring the hardware

- Raspberry as drop-in replacement for the remote control receiver
- Reverse engineering signals to be sent by Raspberry to the truck's main control unit
- Sensors directly connected to the Raspberry

### Using Robot Operating System (ROS) as main software

- [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) as foundation on Raspberry and remote laptop
- Separate subscribable topics per sensor (ultrasonic, camera, accelerometer)

### Architecture and Control

- Streaming of sensor data via wifi from Raspberry to remote laptop (real-time)
- Control logic implemented on remote laptop
- Sending controls from remote laptop to Raspberry (real-time)

# The Self-Driving Logic

## Python, OpenCV, ArUco markers

---
# Implementation: The Self-Driving Logic

### Platooning Logic

.pull-left[
- Follow [ArUco](https://www.google.de) marker (simple 2D barcode, similar to QR-Code) detected via camera

- Maintain distance to truck in front as measured by ultrasonic sensor

- Features: Adaptive steering and distance, real-time [ArUco](https://www.google.de) detection
